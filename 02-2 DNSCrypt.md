# DNSCrypt (DNS over HTTPS using Cloudflare)

_Refer to https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/DNSCrypt-2.0 for more information._

## Installation

```bash
sudo apt install dnscrypt-proxy
```

While running this command you can encounter error like this:

```
Job for dnscrypt-proxy.socket failed.
See "systemctl status dnscrypt-proxy.socket" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
A dependency job for dnscrypt-proxy.service failed. See 'journalctl -xe' for details.
```

It's because it tries to use the same port as Pi-Hole, you can ignore it and proceed.

## For read only filesystem

```bash
# Check permissions with `stat -c "%a %U %G %n" /var/cache/`
sudo mkdir -p /data/var/cache -m 755

sudo cp -ax /var/cache/dnscrypt-proxy /data/var/cache
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
```
