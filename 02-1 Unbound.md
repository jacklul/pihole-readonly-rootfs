## For read only filesystem

Only when [followed this](/01%20Read-only%20system.md)!

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/etc
sudo mkdir -p /data/var/lib

sudo cp -a /etc/unbound /data/etc
sudo cp -a /var/lib/unbound/ /data/var/lib
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
```
# Unbound
/data/etc/unbound        /etc/unbound        none  bind,nofail  0 0
/data/var/lib/unbound    /var/lib/unbound    none  bind,nofail  0 0
```

```bash
sudo mount -a
```
